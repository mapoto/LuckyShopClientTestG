# Shop WPF project

A tutorial project for shopping client application. Uses SQL Client connection (.NET 8) and MVVM architecture (from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsjTZxIVxxo&t=5s)).

## Preview

Very simple interaction where a customer orders a set of product available from the database products table. The order are sent to a separate order table. All connection is carried out by SQL query.
